# Keyword Extraction Using KeyBERT, TF-IDF, Word Cloud, and YAKE
The importance of the ability to extract keywords is ever-growing as more and more text data become available. In this post, I illustrate how we can use implement various keyword extraction techniques in Python. Specifically, I will focus on Word Cloud, TF-IDF, KeyBERT, and YAKE. To demonstrate, I will use lease disclosure data that I use in my UC Berkeley Haas Dissertation, available <a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3689446">here</a>.

# Problem Statement
Starting in 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board mandated firms to provide a detailed lease disclosure. Since it is the first time we are observing detailed lease information, many stakeholders, practitioners, and academics are interested in learning about them.
